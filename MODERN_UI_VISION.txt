ARDOUR MODERN UI VISION
=======================

The most approachable DAW in existence.
AI-first. Zero friction. Full power underneath.


WHO WE ARE BUILDING FOR
------------------------

Someone with a musical idea and no engineering degree. They don't know
what a compressor ratio is. They don't want to learn signal routing.
They want to make music and have it sound good.

They've maybe used GarageBand. Maybe BandLab. Maybe nothing at all.
They opened our app because it's free, it's open source, and someone
told them it was good. Within thirty seconds they will decide if this
is for them or not.

We are not building for the person who loves tweaking compressor
knee curves. That person is welcome — everything they need is one
toggle away — but they are not who we design the default experience for.


WHAT WE BELIEVE
----------------

The best interface is the one you don't have to learn.

Every visible control that a new user doesn't understand is friction.
Every button they're afraid to click is friction. Every panel that
makes them think "this isn't for me" is friction. We eliminate
friction ruthlessly.

No functionality is removed. Not a single routing option, plugin
parameter, automation lane, or MIDI feature. We are changing what is
VISIBLE BY DEFAULT. The full Ardour — every knob and wire — is one
toggle away for anyone who wants it.

If the AI can do it, we don't need a visible control for it. The user
says "add reverb to the vocals" — they never need to see a plugin
browser. The user says "make the drums quieter in the chorus" — they
never need to find an automation lane. The AI is the interface. The
visual UI is feedback.


THE DEFAULT EXPERIENCE
-----------------------

When you open this app for the first time, you see:

  - Your tracks, with names and colors
  - A volume fader and meter for each one
  - Mute, Solo, Record — three buttons you already understand
  - Play, Stop, Record — transport you already understand
  - An AI bar that says: "Ask me anything"

That's it. No plugin slots. No routing matrix. No send buses. No pan
knobs. No automation lanes. No MIDI channel selectors. No monitor
section. Not because those things don't exist — they all do — but
because you don't need to see them to make music.

The AI bar is the most prominent element on screen. It is the answer
to every question of "how do I...?" You type what you want. It happens.
You hear the result. If you don't like it, you say so.


THE FULL EXPERIENCE
--------------------

One toggle. Simple to Full. Instant. Non-destructive.

The full mixer appears: every plugin slot, every send, every pan
control, every routing option. The same session, the same sound,
just more visible controls. For the user who has grown, who wants
direct manipulation, who came from Logic or Pro Tools and wants to
see everything.

The two modes share the same session. Nothing is lost switching
between them. A session built entirely through AI commands in Simple
Mode is a complete Ardour session with real plugins, real automation,
real routing. Open it in Full Mode and it's all there.


THE VISUAL LANGUAGE
--------------------

Flat. Warm. Quiet.

No bevels, no 3D shadows, no raised buttons, no LED indicators.
Every surface is a flat colored rectangle. Depth comes from color
value alone — lighter means closer, darker means further.

The palette is warm dark grays. Not clinical, not cold. The interface
feels like a well-designed room at night — comfortable, focused,
calm. When nothing is active, the screen is nearly monochrome.
Active states — record, solo, mute — fill their buttons with color.
That's the only thing that demands your attention.

Generous spacing everywhere. Elements breathe. Nothing feels cramped.
The UI communicates confidence through emptiness: we don't need to
fill every pixel to prove we're powerful.

One design system. Transport buttons follow the same rules as mixer
buttons follow the same rules as editor buttons. No special cases.


WHAT THIS IS NOT
-----------------

This is not a toy. The AI layer means a user in Simple Mode can
accomplish things that would require years of training in a traditional
DAW. The ceiling is as high as Ardour's engine allows. The floor is
as low as "press record and sing."

This is not a dumbed-down fork. Every session is a full Ardour session.
Every feature exists. We are curating visibility, not capability.

This is not competing with Pro Tools on control density. We are
competing on the feeling you get when you open the app. The feeling
should be: I can do this.
